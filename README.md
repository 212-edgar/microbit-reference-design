# micro:bit Reference Design

This repository stores the microbit Educational Foundation's reference design.

The purpose of this design is to help people turn the inventions they've made
with a micro:bit into a standalone board, and to learn more about how things
are made and manufactured.

The full documentation for the reference design lives at
